#### 1.1 | Cells

Cells contain molecules which will reference to througout the notebook: **<mark style="background-color:#F1C40F;color:white;border-radius:5px;opacity:0.9">amino acids</mark>**, **<mark style="background-color:#F1C40F;color:white;border-radius:5px;opacity:0.9">nucleotides</mark>**, **<mark style="background-color:#F1C40F;color:white;border-radius:5px;opacity:0.9">proteins</mark>**

A **<mark style="background-color:#F1C40F;color:white;border-radius:5px;opacity:0.9">cell</mark>** is mostly composed of water:
> - a bacteria cell has a weight composition of roughly 70% water & 30% <b>chemical origin</b>, 
> - <b>7% -> small molecules</b> Inc. **<mark style="background-color:#F1C40F;color:white;border-radius:5px;opacity:0.9">amino acids</mark>** and **<mark style="background-color:#F1C40F;color:white;border-radius:5px;opacity:0.9">nucleotides</mark>**
> - 23% -> <b>macro molecules</b> (**<mark style="background-color:#F1C40F;color:white;border-radius:5px;opacity:0.9">proteins</mark>**,lipids,polysaccharides)



According to their internal structure, they can be divided into to major categories:

> - **<mark style="background-color:#F1C40F;color:white;border-radius:5px;opacity:0.9">Prokaryotic</mark>** cells : have no nucleus or internal membranes
> - **<mark style="background-color:#F1C40F;color:white;border-radius:5px;opacity:0.9">Eukaryotic</mark>** cells : which have a defined <b>nucleus</b>, <b>internal membranes</b> and functional elements called <b>organelles</b>.


- At a structural level, all cells are surrounded by a structure called cell <b>membrane</b> or <b>plasma membrane</b>. 
- This <b>membrane</b> is permeable to molecules that cells need to absorb from or excrete to the outside medium.
- Within the cell we find the <b>cytoplasm</b> (largely composed of water), which serves as the medium for the cell

#### <b><span style='color:#F1C40F'>COMPLEMENTARY STRANDS IN DNA</span></b>

- DNA is a molecule composed of **<span style='color:#F1C40F'>two complementary strands</span>** that form and stick together due to the connections established between the nucleotides in both strands
- This is made possible by due to the chemical phenomenon:
    - Where **<mark style="background-color:#F1C40F;color:white;border-radius:5px;opacity:0.9">Adenine (A)</mark>** bonds only with **<mark style="background-color:#F1C40F;color:white;border-radius:5px;opacity:0.9">Thymine (T)</mark>** nucleotides; as a result of **two hydrogen connections**
    - Similarly, **<mark style="background-color:#F1C40F;color:white;border-radius:5px;opacity:0.9">Guanine (G)</mark>** bonds only with **<mark style="background-color:#F1C40F;color:white;border-radius:5px;opacity:0.9">Cytosine (C)</mark>** nucleotides by three hydrogen connections

#### <b><span style='color:#F1C40F'>REVERSE COMPLEMENT</span></b>

- This results in **two complementary** and **anti-parallel strands** (connected in opposite directions), if we know the nucleotide sequence in one of the strands, we can get the sequence in the opposite strand by taking the complement of its nucleotides, which are also read backwards, thus we have the **reverse complement** of the other strand.
- It has become a **standard to describe the DNA though only one** of the strands, due to this **complementarity** using <b>[A,T,G,C]</b>.
- The existence of these two strands is essential in order to **pass on genetic information** to new cells and **produce proteins**.
